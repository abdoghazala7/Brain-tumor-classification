## Overview
This project is a deep dive into using deep learning for the classification of brain tumors from MRI images. We explore and compare two main approaches: building a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch, and implementing an advanced transfer learning strategy using a pre-trained `EfficientNetB0` model.

The goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy while understanding the trade-offs between model size, efficiency, and performance. The final model successfully achieved a stunning **98% accuracy** on the unseen test data.

## ‚ú® Key Features
* Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's distribution.
* A powerful **Custom CNN** built from scratch, which served as a strong baseline, achieving ~96% accuracy.
* An advanced **Transfer Learning** strategy using `EfficientNetB0` and the `timm` library.
* Implementation of a three-phase **Gradual Fine-Tuning** technique to maximize performance.
* A detailed comparison between the two final models, analyzing the trade-offs between accuracy and parameter count.
