## **üìú Overview**

This repository documents the end-to-end journey of building a state-of-the-art deep learning model to classify brain tumors from MRI images. The project explores and compares two sophisticated approaches: a custom-built CNN and an advanced transfer learning strategy.

The final model, an EfficientNetB0 trained with a multi-phase gradual fine-tuning technique, achieved a stunning **98% accuracy** and is now deployed as an interactive web app.

## **üìà Project Workflow**

The project followed a structured, iterative methodology to achieve the best possible results:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated class distribution, image dimensions, and visualized samples to understand the dataset.  
2. **Custom CNN Baseline:** Built a large, powerful CNN from scratch to establish a strong performance baseline. This model achieved an impressive \~95% accuracy.  
3. **Advanced Transfer Learning:** Implemented a state-of-the-art EfficientNetB0 model, leveraging pre-trained weights from ImageNet.  
4. **Gradual Fine-Tuning:** Employed a three-phase fine-tuning strategy to maximize the transfer learning model's performance, which involved sequentially unfreezing layers and using differential learning rates.  
5. **Final Evaluation & Comparison:** Performed a detailed evaluation of both models on the test set, comparing them on accuracy, AUC, and parameter efficiency.  
6. **Deployment:** Built a user-friendly web interface with Streamlit and deployed the final, best-performing model to the cloud.

## **üèÜ Final Results & Analysis**

The gradual fine-tuning strategy proved superior, yielding a model that is both highly accurate and remarkably efficient.
